# OpenWave Trademark Policy

## Trademark Ownership

"OpenWave" and the OpenWave logo (if applicable) are trademarks of OpenWave Labs ("we" or "us").

## Purpose

This policy explains how you may and may not use the OpenWave trademarks. Our goal is to:

1. Protect the OpenWave brand and reputation
1. Prevent confusion about the source or affiliation of projects
1. Allow reasonable community use of our trademarks

## Permitted Uses

You may use the OpenWave trademark without permission to:

- **Reference the project:** Accurately refer to the OpenWave software project in text, articles, documentation, or presentations
- **Link to our repository:** Use "Powered by OpenWave" or "Built with OpenWave" with a link to our official repository
- **Community discussion:** Discuss OpenWave in forums, social media, blog posts, or academic papers
- **Modified versions:** State that your project is "based on OpenWave" or "derived from OpenWave" (but see restrictions below)

## Prohibited Uses

You may NOT use the OpenWave trademark to:

- **Suggest endorsement:** Imply that we sponsor, endorse, or are affiliated with your project, product, or service
- **Create confusion:** Use "OpenWave" in a way that could confuse users about the source of the software
- **Misleading names:** Name your product or service "OpenWave" or include "OpenWave" prominently in product names in a confusing way
- **Domain names:** Register domain names containing "OpenWave" (except for clear fan sites or community resources with our permission)
- **Forks and derivatives:** Create a competing project called "OpenWave [Something]" without clear differentiation

**Note:** OpenWave is licensed under AGPL-3.0, which allows commercial use. This trademark policy does not restrict commercial use of the software itself, only misuse of the "OpenWave" trademark.

## Modified Versions and Forks

If you create a modified version or fork of OpenWave:

- ✅ **DO** clearly state it is based on or derived from OpenWave
- ✅ **DO** use a different project name to avoid confusion
- ✅ **DO** link back to the official OpenWave repository
- ❌ **DON'T** use "OpenWave" as your project name
- ❌ **DON'T** imply your fork is the official OpenWave project

**Good examples:**

- "QuantumSim (based on OpenWave)"
- "WaveSimPro - a fork of OpenWave"

**Bad examples:**

- "OpenWave Pro"
- "OpenWave Commercial Edition"

## Logo Usage

If we create an official OpenWave logo:

- You may use it only to refer to the official OpenWave project
- You must not modify, distort, or alter the logo
- You must not use the logo in a way that suggests endorsement

## Enforcement

We will enforce this trademark policy to protect the OpenWave brand. Violations may result in:

- Request to cease use
- Legal action if necessary

We prefer to resolve issues cooperatively and will work with you in good faith.
