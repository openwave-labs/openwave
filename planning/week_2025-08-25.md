THIS WEEK PLAN -------------------------------------------------
Start building our first module group: spacetime, by modeling spring-mass functions for granules, unit_cells & the lattice structure (first in 2D, latter in 3D)
Setup OpenWave modules infrastructure
​Model spacetime functions into phase 1: the fundamental particle
