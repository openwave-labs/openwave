# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in OpenWave, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email:** Send details to the project maintainers (contact information available in the repository)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories:** Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature at [Security Advisories](https://github.com/openwave-labs/openwave/security/advisories/new)

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (optional but appreciated)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Assessment:** We will investigate and assess the severity within 7 days
- **Updates:** We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution:** We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities promptly
- **Credit:** With your permission, we will credit you in the security advisory

### Scope

This security policy applies to:

- The OpenWave core simulation engine
- Official OpenWave packages and releases
- Code in the main repository

This policy does **not** cover:

- Third-party dependencies (report to their maintainers)
- Unofficial forks or modifications
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without demonstrated impact

### Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in good faith to be authorized. We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and data destruction
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue
- Report vulnerabilities promptly and do not disclose publicly before resolution
- Do not use vulnerabilities for malicious purposes

### Supported Versions
