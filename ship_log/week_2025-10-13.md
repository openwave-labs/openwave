# [SHIP LOG] week: 2025-10-13

## SUMMARY

A week advancing OpenWave from single-source radial waves to multi-source interference patterns while establishing physics-accurate terminology throughout the codebase. Major focus on visualization tools and wave analysis capabilities.

**Key Achievements**:

1. **Multi-Source Wave Physics**: Expanded from single to 10 simultaneous wave sources, enabling complex interference pattern studies and wave superposition validation
2. **Advanced Visualization Tools**: Introduced probe granules, borescope camera, near-far field visualization, and comprehensive wave diagnostics module
3. **Terminology Standardization**: Completed systematic transition from "particle" to "granule-medium" language, aligning codebase with EWT wave-centric paradigm
4. **Documentation Revamp**: Complete restructuring of API references, module documentation, and technical analysis (Taichi vs Warp comparison)

**Impact**: This week transforms OpenWave into a true virtual laboratory for wave physics research, with professional-grade diagnostic tools and the foundation for studying particle formation from wave convergence.

## NEW FEATURES: VISUALIZATION & ANALYSIS TOOLS

**Wave Analysis Tools:**

- **Probe Granules**: Sample granules (in red) serve as a visual probe for better wave visualization, and we can also attach sensors on it from the diagnostics module, and measure quantities like position, speed, acceleration, momentum, energy, etc

- **Near-Far Fields Visualization**: Implemented visualization distinguishing near and far field wave behavior (Oct 16)
- **Energy Dashboard**: Updated energy monitoring and visualization settings (Oct 18)

**UI Improvements:**

- **Pause Control**: Added pause button to all experiments (Oct 14)
- **Dashboard Refinements**: Refined dashboard labels and diagnostics formatting (Oct 15)
- **Camera Controls**: Fixed camera gimbal lock issue for better navigation (Oct 17)
- **Simulation Domain Naming**: Clarified simulation domain terminology in UI (Oct 14)

- **Axis Display Toggle**: Made axis display configurable per experiment (Oct 13)
