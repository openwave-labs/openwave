# [SHIP LOG] week: 2025-08-18

## SUMMARY

Last week I tested a better Python library for high-performance parallel computing called **Taichi**. Originally developed at MIT, it's now an open-source project maintained by a developers community.

## KEY ACTIVITIES

## Why Taichi?

Taichi addresses our main technical requirements and is specifically designed for:

- Particle-based fluid simulations
- Large-scale spatial computing
- Physical simulations

This matches our use-case perfectly. Since it's an open-source Python library, I'll be implementing this package in our environment and calling their methods from our quantum wave computational algorithms.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Large Capacity Data Containers

- Implements multi-dimensional vector arrays for storing large data sets
- Essential for handling:
  - Large granularity of particle count and motion
  - Ultra-small wavelength resolution
  - Complex particle interactions

### 2. High-Performance Computing

- **Parallel Processing**: GPU or multi-CPU utilization for computationally intensive granule-medium and wave simulations
- **JIT Compilation**: Creates just-in-time compiled kernels, able to run large simulations
- **Resource Optimization**: Uses every ounce of computing power a machine has available

### 3. GUI Visualization

- Handles volume renderings in both 2D and 3D
- Includes widgets for user input
- Features media file export capabilities

## THIS WEEK PLAN WAS

- continue experimenting with different scientific and data visualization libraries
- review AI accelerated development workflow
- review dev roadmap & framework: this will optimize the work of AI pair programmers
- if time allows, start drafting the first module: spacetime!
