## KEY ACTIVITIES

### Researched

Key Achievements

- Implemented spring-mass dynamics for quantum wave propagation using Leapfrog integration (commit a5481e5)
- Added attometer-scale position/velocity storage for improved floating-point precision

Technical Highlights

- Integration Method: Adopted Leapfrog (velocity Verlet) for numerical stability in wave propagation
- Scaling: Attometer-level precision for Planck-scale simulations
- Physics Validation: Wave speed and wavelength validation framework established
