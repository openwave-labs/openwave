# [SHIP LOG] week: 2025-09-08

## SUMMARY

Significant progress on aether_medium.py (aka: Aether) lattice implementation, transitioning from 2D to 3D body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, significantly improving simulation fidelity. Major refactoring of granule physics, improved documentation, and introduction of spherical/sliced lattice variants with performance testing framework.

Key Points:

- Refactored granule physics model with explicit radius/mass calculations
- Introduced spherical and sliced aether_medium variants with performance testing
- Overhauled installation documentation and added development roadmap
- Reorganized codebase structure for better maintainability
- Enhanced constants derivation equations with additional density methods

## KEY ACTIVITIES

### ​aether_medium.py 3D Lattice Implementation​ (aka: The Aether)

​The Aether medium is built! (reminder: called aether_medium module in OpenWave for scientific neutrality).

This week I was able to implement the Lattice class in the 3D BCC topology. Rendering function uses the Lattice class object and render into a 3D window with interactive camera position and dual light sources. The BCC structure can clearly be visible with corner granules forming the cubic lattice and center granules in between.

This clip shows a cube with 1e-16m edges and 1M particle count (granules).

### Scaling System Implemented

Created a backend scaling system that dynamically recomputes granule mass based on particle count, accessible from any module. User parameters are **granule resolution** and **screen resolution**, and the Lattice class argument is the **universe size** for the simulation. For Aether density I used as source paper: Relationship of the Speed of Light to Aether Density.

For Aether density (source paper: Relationship of the Speed of Light to Aether Density), I'm using the density from Planck Mass at a Bohr Radius Sphere (hydrogen atom), ρ = mₚ / (4/3 πrₕ³) = 3.506335701e+22 kg/m³. And calculating granule mass to maintain that density value with 2 granules per scaled unit-cell. Granule radius is proportional to the BCC lattice unit-cell edge / (2e).

Since we're modeling the Aether as an ideal fluid (possibly similar to plasma properties), where viscosity is zero (Reynolds similarity do not apply) and gravity effects on particles are also zero (Froude similarity also do not apply). Its exciting that we're using classical fluid dynamics concepts to model quantum mechanics.

### Architecture & Refactoring

- **3D BCC Lattice Implementation**: Transitioned from 2D to 3D body-centered cubic lattice structure for improved simulation fidelity (commit 6de2840)
- **Granule Model Refactor**: Updated Granule class with explicit radius/mass calculations and parameterized initialization (commit a85ccb7)
- **Module Restructuring**: Reorganized project structure, moving test scripts to dev_sandbox and creating subdirectories (commit 79242c2)

### New Features

- **Performance Testing Suite**: Added comprehensive universe shape tests comparing different lattice implementations
- **Validation Framework**: Introduced validation modules for particle and wave constant derivations

### Memory Optimization

Implemented a data type change under the hood (inside functions and arrays computation):

- Original data: 0.0000000000000001 (1e-16) m
  - data type: float64 (64 bits of memory allocation)
- Converted data in arrays: 100 atto-meter (1am = 1e-18m)
  - data type: float32 (32 bits of memory allocation)

Result: with same memory we doubled the particle count a computer can handle.

In the future, there is still another fine tuning we can make in memory, Taichi implements a specific data type called "Quantized Data Types", closer to 16 bits, where we can define our own data type and squeeze a little more memory performance out of OpenWave.

Same concept is being implemented for mass and time, just under the hood, for computational advantages. On human interfaces (screen and reports) we convert back to m/kg/s.

### Documentation & Setup

- **Installation Guide Overhaul**: Simplified and unified installation instructions for all platforms (commits 964f75f, fe00df4, ddd0ecc)
- **Development Roadmap**: Added comprehensive module status and development roadmap (commit 8adab42)
- **Scientific Source Section**: Expanded README with Energy Wave Theory (EWT) references and context (commit 6a34c5c)
- **Resolution Documentation**: Added detailed comments for QSPACE_RES and SCREEN_RES performance impact (commit a26ec3b)

### Technical Improvements

- **Resolution Configuration**: Refactored SCREEN_RES and QSPACE_RES settings across modules (commit a10af8b)
- **Constants Derivation**: Enhanced constants_derivation_wave.py with additional density derivation methods
- **Camera Orbit**: Updated initial camera parameters for improved visualization (commit 0f0346d)
- **Energy Calculations**: Added energy calculations to aether_medium.py implementation

## NEXT STEPS

- Continue optimization of 3D lattice performance
- Implement wave propagation mechanics in the new lattice structure
- Develop particle formation from wave interactions
- Expand validation suite for EWT constants
