## KEY ACTIVITIES

### Researched: spring-mass systems best practices python implementations

- Dedicated time to evaluate distinct implementation options for:
  - Harmonic oscillators for granule vibrations
  - Spring networks between neighboring granules in the BCC lattice
  - Wave equation propagation through the granule medium

- Evaluated the Neo-Hookean hyperelastic model for soft-bodies, but decided to implement the classical Hooke's law instead, considered a better approach for OpenWave's granule dynamics, that needs needs discrete particle dynamics - individual granules oscillating at quantum frequencies.

- Learned methods to achieve numerical stability in spring-mass systems (techniques in computational physics simulators). Found a common technique in physics simulations where:
  - Each rendered frame runs multiple small physics steps
  - This improves stability (smaller time steps = more accurate physics)
  - Granules can move smoothly even with complex spring interactions

### Drafted the core dynamic logic and time loop

```python
OBJECTS / ATTRIBUTES
BCCGranule()
- single var: mass (m, scalar)
Lattice()
- 1D array: position (p, 3D vector)
- 1D array: velocity (v, 3D vector)
Spring()
- single var: spring stiffness (k, scalar)
- single var: BCC spacing at rest (L0, 3D vector)
  - [1/2 * a, 1/2 * a, 1/2 * a]
- 1D array: index/spring-links (idx, 8D vector)
  - @initialize: indexing + mark for slicing
Timestep()
- single var: timestep (dt, scalar)
```

```python
LOOP LOGIC
every dt frame (while or for loop n frames, max 30fps? = refresh-rate limit):
- inject energy (@energy_wave.py)
  - 1 (or n) granules changed position (displacement)
  - change pos, E = F*d
compute each granule new position (@spacetime.py)
- Fs, v, x = zero # initialize local vars for safety
- compute 8-way 3D granule distance vectors (A-B)
  - x = |B-A| - L0
  - Fs = -k * x
  - a = Fs / m
- find resultant 3D force vector
- Euler Integration
  - v += a * dt # compute new velocity
  - p += v * dt # compute new position
```

### On-Going Research

Differential Equations implementation for wave propagation

- Evaluate differential programming languages
- Use autodiff equations solver
- Use on wave propagation model force from potential energy (F from U, rate of change)

Updates to the dynamic scaling we have implemented

- already implemented: length & mass
- now need: to scale spring forces (coulomb & k) and time

## Technical Development Activities

Major Code Cleanup & Refactoring

- Removed 3,590 lines of experimental code from dev_sandbox/ directory
- Eliminated redundant profiling scripts and test implementations
- Consolidated experimental work into main qspace_render.py module

Aether Medium Calculation Improvements

- Removed additional scaling from Aether Medium calculations for simplification
- Refactored granule radius normalization logic for better accuracy
- Improved granule size control mechanisms with better parameter handling

Visualization & Rendering Enhancements

- Added block-slice visualization option to controls for better 3D space analysis
- Refactored camera initialization and input handling for smoother interaction
- Multiple iterations on qspace_render.py improving rendering performance

Documentation & Organization

- Renamed scientific source files with consistent numbering (01-09) for better reference
- Updated contribution guidelines and branding references
- Clarified comments in constants and Aether Medium modules

Technical Highlights

- Performance Focus: Removal of experimental code and optimization of core rendering loops
- Cleaner Architecture: Consolidation from multiple experimental files into single refined implementation
- Better User Controls: Enhanced visualization options with block/plane slicing capabilities
- Simplified Physics: Removal of additional scaling while maintaining accuracy

Development Trajectory

The week shows a clear transition from experimental phase to refinement, with focus on consolidating working features, improving performance, and preparing a cleaner codebase for future development phases.

## Fun informal AI summary

### Getting Ready to Make Stuff Move! 🚀

**The Big Picture**: Finally got all the tools lined up to start making granules actually move and interact - this is
where the physics gets real!

What Got Done:

### Spring-Mass Research Deep Dive

- Went down the rabbit hole on how to make granules bounce and vibrate properly
- Almost got seduced by fancy Neo-Hookean hyperelastic physics but stuck with good ol' Hooke's law (keep it simple, stupid!)
- Found a neat trick: run multiple tiny physics steps per rendered frame = smoother, more stable simulations

### The Core Dynamics Blueprint

Sketched out the main loop that'll make everything tick:

- Granules get mass, position, velocity
- Springs connect them with stiffness values
- Every timestep: inject energy → calculate forces → update positions → repeat
- Classic physics loop with 8-way BCC lattice connections

### Still Cooking

- Figuring out differential equations for wave propagation (autodiff might be the way)
- Need to nail down force and time scaling (already got length & mass sorted)

### Massive Cleanup Operation

- Nuked 3,590 lines of experimental cruft from dev_sandbox - goodbye clutter!
- Everything consolidated into one clean qspace_render.py
- Added cool block-slice visualization for better 3D exploration
- Files now numbered 01-09 because who doesn't love proper ordering

**The Vibe**: Moving from "let's try everything" experimental chaos to "let's build this properly" focused development.

The foundation's solid, now it's time to make granules dance!

**Bottom line**: Got the physics framework ready, cleaned house big time, and prepped for implementing actual subatomic dynamics. Next up: making waves propagate through the lattice! 🌊
