# [SHIP LOG] week: 2025-08-04

## SUMMARY

This week focused on establishing the project foundation, refining requirements based on updated granule mass equations, and beginning development of OpenWave's first module - the **waves engine**. Additionally, I explored data visualization libraries and continued refining our AI-accelerated development workflow.

## Initial Planning & Setup

### Constants Strategy

**Decision**: Start with Wave Constants for their alignment with the energy wave concept

**Future consideration**: Extend OpenWave features to "translate" Classical Constants into the simulation

### Project Commitment

**Time allocation**: ~30 hours/week for the next 4 months (minimum)

### Collaboration approach

- Heavy lifting handled independently to avoid disrupting other work
- Direction and validation needed for physics engine alignment with EWT model
- Requirements and architecture maturation on Miro board

### Requirements Refinement

- Received updated granule mass equations
- Constants source documentation
- Original requirements documentation
- Created shared folder with published papers for review
- Awaiting feedback on additional relevant papers to include

## Key Activities

### 1. Waves Engine Module Development

**Purpose**: Create a core engine for modeling EWT energy waves behavior on aether granules

**Planned functionalities**:

- Wave properties (wavelength, amplitude, period, speed, energy)
- Wave emission mechanics
- Wave reflection algorithms
- Wave propagation modeling
- Wave interactions (constructive and destructive interference)
- Wave energy transfer mechanisms
- Additional fundamental wave functionalities

### 2. Data Visualization Research

**Discovery**: Found an open-source Python library for animating mathematical functions in 3D

- Maintained by a community of ~500 programmers
- Ideal for our visualization needs
- Planning experimental implementations with visual demos

**Development approach**:

- Initial focus on backend functions only
- Command-line accessibility prioritized
- GUI development deferred until backend is robust

### 3. AI-Accelerated Development

**Current experiments**:

- Testing GPT-5 (newly released)
- Allowing OpenAI break-in time for bug fixing and performance stabilization
- Testing OpenAI Codex for safe, fast coding practices
- Ensuring GPT training on our specific Python libraries
- Documenting workflows for optimal AI assistance

### 4. Documentation & Tracking

- Comprehensive documentation on Miro board
- Regular updates on current tasks
- Reference materials for ongoing work
- Shared folder with published papers

## Terminology Decision

### Discussion on Wave Nomenclature

**Question raised**: Should we use "Energy Waves" or "Quantum Waves"?

**Decision**: Use **"Energy Waves"** terminology

## Next Steps

- Continue waves engine module implementation
- Develop visualization prototypes
- Refine AI-assisted coding workflows
- Maintain comprehensive documentation on Miro board
- Review additional papers for requirements inclusion
- Mature requirements and architecture on Miro board

## Python Decision

>is python a good language for running quantum scale simulations with large data arrays?

Python paired with Taichi Lang is actually an excellent choice for quantum-scale simulations with large data arrays, and here's why it aligns perfectly with your OpenWave EWT simulation requirements:

## Why Python + Taichi is Ideal for OpenWave

Taichi's Strengths for EWT Simulations:

- **Massive Parallelization:** Taichi compiles Python-like code to run on GPUs, which is crucial for simulating the millions of granules in your spacetime lattice (ranging from 10⁻³⁵ to 10⁻¹⁷ meter spacing)

- **High-Performance Array Operations:** Perfect for the large 3D arrays needed to represent the granular spacetime structure across multiple scales (10⁻¹⁶ to 10⁻⁷ meters universe radius depending on phase)

- **Memory Efficiency:** Critical when simulating Planck-scale granules with properties like mass, position, velocity, and wave displacement

## Computational Challenges from EWT Requirements

Based on your project knowledge, the simulation faces these specific performance demands:

### Scale Complexity

- Phase 1: Universe radius ~10⁻¹⁶ m with granule spacing 10⁻³⁵ to 10⁻¹⁷ m

- Phase 2-5: Scaling up to 10⁻⁷ m radius for molecule formation

- Granule Count: Potentially trillions of granules requiring spring constant calculations, harmonic motion, and wave propagation

### Real-time Physics

- Simple harmonic motion for each granule (sine wave displacement)
- Spring constant forces between granules
- Wave propagation at light speed (3×10⁸ m/s)
- Complex energy calculations for longitudinal/transverse waves

## Python's Ecosystem Advantages

You're absolutely right about Python's big data capabilities:

- **NumPy/SciPy:** Essential for the complex wave equations and mathematical operations in your EWT model

- **Visualization:** matplotlib, plotly for the visual demonstration component

- **Scientific Computing:** Established libraries for physics simulations

- **Development Speed:** Rapid prototyping for the multi-phase development approach

## Performance Strategy

The EWT documents acknowledge the "granularity vs. performance" challenge and suggest:

- **Scalable resolution:** User-tunable granule density

- **Localized calculations:** Focus compute-intensive operations on specific volumes

- **Scaling factors:** Consistent scaling across distance measurements to manage computational load

Taichi Lang specifically addresses these needs by automatically optimizing array operations and parallelizing the granule interactions across GPU cores.

>**Bottom Line:** Python + Taichi is not just suitable but potentially optimal for OpenWave, giving you both the scientific computing ecosystem of Python and the raw computational power needed for Planck-scale granular physics simulations.
