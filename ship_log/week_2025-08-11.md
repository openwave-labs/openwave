# [SHIP LOG] week: 2025-08-11

## SUMMARY

Last week I explored various development tools and established the foundational infrastructure for the OpenWave project, focusing on AI-assisted development workflows and visualization capabilities.

## KEY ACTIVITIES

### 1. Coding Agents Evaluation

**Tools tested**: GPT5 & VSCode Copilot

- **Benefits**:
  - Great pair programmers that significantly reduce manual coding time
  - Excellent for navigating unknown technical areas
  - Provides valuable coding acceleration

- **Challenges**:
  - Frequent debugging required
  - Constant bug generation necessitates intense code review
  - Finding the balance between acceleration benefits and additional testing overhead

- **Best Practices Identified**:
  - Start small and work incrementally
  - Define solid strategy/framework with clear checkpoints
  - Begin with MVP and iterate carefully
  - Limit code changes to small, controlled batches
  - Avoid overly complex prompts that lead to large, error-prone tasks

### 2. Codex Implementation

- Helps analyze and run the codebase effectively
- Identifies inconsistencies and bugs
- Ensures compliance with best practices

### 3. Python Data Visualization Research

**Purpose**: Implement OpenWave's visualization features for validating EWT wave equations

**Findings**:

- Discovered promising open-source Python packages
- Capabilities include:
  - Smooth programmatic animations
  - Point-clouds, stream-lines, vector-fields
  - Wave-guides and color-gradients
  - Both 2D and 3D rendering support

**Progress**:

- Created demo with simple random functions
- Using sandbox repo for testing

### 4. Project Infrastructure

**Project Bootstrap**:

- OpenWave repo scaffold completed
- Updated on GitHub with boilerplate structure
- Initial dependencies installation completed

**Ship's Log**:

- Created dedicated section in Miro board
- Established regular work updates system for tracking progress
