# NUMERICAL STABILITY ANALYSIS

**Key Difference**: Spring-Mass vs Wave Equation PDE

**Reference**: See `/openwave/validations/stability_analysis_wave.py` for automated CFL stability verification

## Spring-Mass System (LEVEL-0) - THE IMPOSSIBLE TRIANGLE

Your spring-mass experiments hit a fundamental barrier:

            / \
           /   \
          /     \
    Stability --- Human-Visible Motion
```

### The Problem

- Required spring stiffness: k ≈ 5.56×10⁴⁴ N/m (Planck scale)
- Natural frequency: ω_n = √(k/m) ≈ 2.87×10¹⁷ rad/s
- CFL critical timestep: dt < 2/ω_n ≈ 7×10⁻¹⁸ s
- Actual frame time: dt ≈ 0.016 s (60 FPS)
- Violation: 24 orders of magnitude! 💥

### Results from experiments

- ❌ Euler: NaN at 0.1s even with 1000 substeps
- ❌ Leapfrog: NaN at 0.4s even with 1000 substeps
- ⚠️ XPBD: Stable but waves ~8× too slow (12.5% of c)
- ✅ PSHO (Phase-Synchronized): Perfect but bypasses force mechanics

## Wave Equation PDE (LEVEL-1) - FUNDAMENTAL ADVANTAGE

### The Solution

The wave equation ψ̈ = c²∇²ψ has the SAME CFL condition but with a CRITICAL DIFFERENCE:

```python
# Spring-Mass CFL (LEVEL-0)
dt_critical = 2/ω_n = 2/√(k/m)
# Problem: k must be HUGE for realistic wave speed!

# Wave Equation CFL (LEVEL-1):
dt_critical = dx/(c√3)
# Solution: Apply SLOW_MO to c directly!
c_slowed = c / SLOW_MO
dt_critical_slowed = dx/(c_slowed√3)  # Now feasible!
```

### Why This Works

1. Spring-Mass: Stiffness k is FIXED by physics → ω_n is FIXED → dt_critical is FIXED → UNSTABLE
2. Wave PDE: Wave speed c can be SLOWED without breaking physics → dt_critical becomes FEASIBLE → STABLE

### From stability analysis script

**Script**: `/openwave/validations/stability_analysis_wave.py`

**Example output** (for 6 fm³ universe, 1B voxels):

```python
# Without SLOW_MO:
dt_critical = dx / (c * √3) ≈ 2.4e-27 s  # Rontosecond scale!
dt_frame = 1/60 ≈ 0.016 s
Violation: ~10²⁴× 💥 UNSTABLE!

# With SLOW_MO = 10²⁵:
c_slowed = c / 10²⁵ = 3 × 10⁻¹⁷ m/s
dt_critical_slowed = dx / (c_slowed * √3) ≈ 0.024 s
dt_frame = 1/60 ≈ 0.016 s
✓ STABLE! (dt_frame < dt_critical_slowed)
```

**Safety Factor**: CFL factor = (c_slowed·dt / dx)² ≈ 0.33 (within 1/3 limit for 3D 6-connectivity)

**Key Parameters Tested**:

- Voxel edge: dx from `WaveField.voxel_edge`
- Wave speed: c = `constants.EWAVE_SPEED` = 2.998×10⁸ m/s
- SLOW_MO factor: `config.SLOW_MO` (configurable, typically ~10²⁵)
- Frame rates: 60 FPS (dt = 0.0167s) and 30 FPS (dt = 0.0333s)

## Why You Won't Have Numerical Explosion Now

### The Key Insight

Your spring-mass system failed because:

1. You needed k ≈ 10⁴⁴ N/m for realistic wave speed
2. This created ω_n ≈ 10¹⁷ rad/s
3. CFL demanded dt < 10⁻¹⁷ s
4. But visualization needed dt ≈ 0.016 s
5. Gap unbridgeable → explosion

Your wave equation system succeeds because:

1. You need c = 3×10⁸ m/s for realistic wave speed
2. CFL demands dt < dx/(c√3) ≈ 2.4×10⁻²⁷ s
3. Apply SLOW_MO: c_slowed = c/10²⁵ = 3×10⁻¹⁷ m/s
4. New CFL: dt < dx/(c_slowed√3) ≈ 0.024 s
5. Visualization needs dt ≈ 0.016 s
6. 0.016 < 0.024 → ✓ STABLE!

## Validation & Testing

**Automated Stability Check**:

Run the stability analysis script to verify your configuration:

```bash
python openwave/validations/stability_analysis_wave.py
```

**What it verifies**:

1. CFL condition satisfaction for 60 FPS and 30 FPS
2. Safety margins (how much headroom exists)
3. Required SLOW_MO values if unstable
4. Recommended mitigation strategies

**Expected Output**:

```text
✓ STABLE at 60 FPS (dt=1.67e-02 s ≤ dt_crit=2.41e-02 s)
  Safety margin: 1.44× (CFL factor = 0.694)
```

## Implementation Requirements

**Critical Implementation Details** (see `02b_WAVE_ENGINE_propagate.md`):

1. **Apply SLOW_MO to wave speed**, not timestep:

   ```python
   c_slowed = constants.EWAVE_SPEED / config.SLOW_MO * freq_boost
   ```

2. **Use fixed timestep strategy**, not elapsed time:

   ```python
   dt_physics = 1/60  # Fixed (e.g., 60 FPS)
   c_slowed = c / SLOW_MO  # Slow wave speed instead
   ```

3. **Monitor CFL factor** during simulation:

   ```python
   cfl_factor = (c_am * dt / dx_am)**2  # Should be ≤ 1/3 for 3D
   ```

4. **Use attometer scaling** for numerical precision:

   ```python
   dx_am = voxel_edge / constants.ATTOMETER  # [am]
   c_am = c_slowed / constants.ATTOMETER     # [am/s]
   ```

## No Substeps Required

**Critical Difference**: LEVEL-1 does **NOT** need the substep technique that LEVEL-0 required.

### Why Spring-Mass Needed Substeps

From your spring-mass experiments, substeps were an attempt to satisfy CFL:

```python
# Spring-Mass Problem (LEVEL-0):
dt_frame = 1/30  # 0.033s per frame
dt_critical = 2/ω_n ≈ 7×10⁻¹⁸ s

# Required substeps per frame:
N_substeps = dt_frame / dt_critical
           = 0.033 / 7×10⁻¹⁸
           ≈ 4.7 × 10¹⁵ substeps  # IMPOSSIBLE!

# What you tried:
N_substeps = 1000  # Still exploded! NaN at 0.4s
```

**From `2_findings.md`**:

> "Substeps needed for stability: 39,804,942
> You're using: 200 substeps
> ❌ UNSTABLE! Need 40M substeps (120M iterations/second)"

The substep technique **failed** because even with 1000 substeps per frame, you were still 10¹² orders of magnitude short of what was needed.

### Why Wave Equation DOESN'T Need Substeps

The wave equation approach eliminates the substep requirement entirely:

```python
# Wave Equation Solution (LEVEL-1):
dt_frame = 1/60  # 0.0167s per frame (60 FPS)
dt_critical_slowed = dx / (c_slowed * √3) ≈ 0.024 s

# Required substeps per frame:
N_substeps = dt_frame / dt_critical_slowed
           = 0.0167 / 0.024
           ≈ 0.7 substeps  # Less than 1!

# What you use:
N_substeps = 1  # Single timestep per frame! ✓ STABLE
```

**Key Insight**: By applying SLOW_MO to wave speed (not timestep), the critical timestep becomes **LARGER** than the frame timestep. No substeps needed!

### Comparison Table

| Technique | Spring-Mass (LEVEL-0) | Wave PDE (LEVEL-1) |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Substeps needed** | 40 million per frame | **0** (single step) |
| **What you tried** | 1000 substeps → NaN | Not applicable |
| **Why it failed** | k is FIXED by physics | Not applicable |
| **Why it succeeds** | Not applicable | c can be SLOWED |
| **Computational cost** | 40M iterations/frame (impossible) | 1 iteration/frame ✓ |
| **Artifact complexity** | Complex substep loop + accumulator | **Simple single step** |

### Code Simplification

**LEVEL-0 (with substeps artifact)**:

```python
# Complex substep loop needed
def update_frame(dt_frame):
    dt_sub = dt_frame / num_substeps  # Split frame time
    for substep in range(num_substeps):  # Typically 200-1000
        compute_forces()
        integrate_euler(dt_sub)  # Still explodes!
        apply_damping()
```

**LEVEL-1 (no substeps needed)**:

```python
# Simple single-step per frame
def update_frame(dt_frame):
    propagate_wave(dt_frame, freq_boost)  # Just once! ✓
    track_amplitude_envelope()
    compute_wave_direction()
```

**Result**: LEVEL-1 is not only stable but also **simpler** - no substep loops, no timestep splitting, no accumulator artifacts.

## Summary

LEVEL-1 wave equation is essentially a **grid-based PSHO** - you're directly solving the wave equation via PDE, not simulating forces through springs. This is why it will work where spring-mass failed!

**Bottom Line**: You've already discovered the solution in your PSHO experiments - LEVEL-1 is that same principle but on a voxel grid instead of particle lattice. **No numerical explosion expected!** 🎯

**Bonus**: No substep complexity - just one clean timestep per frame! 🚀
