"""Core package for the OpenWave project.

OpenWave is an open-source subatomic wave simulator that supports exploration
of fundamental physics theories.

It's built as a computational physics toolkit applying classical wave mechanics
for modeling matter and energy phenomena using wave-field dynamics.
