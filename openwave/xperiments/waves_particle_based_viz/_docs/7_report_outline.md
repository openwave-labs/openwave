# Report Outline

## Initial-Production Prompt

Lets document all the wave-dynamics journey, implementation, findings and every detail in a final report, including critical points from our conversation, and also:

- review all the .md files for extra context (i saved most of our conversation in the folder /xperiments)
- i created a file final_report.md for the report content
- make sure we adhere and include:
  - Suggested title (change if you find better words related to the work): Computational limits and solution for simulating granule-medium quantum dynamics at Planck scale
  - layout: i'll convert all to 1-column PDF later
  - authors, date, keywords
  - abstract
  - terminology (notation, constants)
  - background
  - equations (in latex)
  - code snippets (re-read the radial_wave.py and qwave_radial.py to get the formula exactly as in the code now, also include that)
  - some images are located at the readme.md file (gifs at "Model spacetime with real physics accuracy and render it in 3D" and "Usage" sections)
  - experiments, tables, plots, charts
  - prototypes
  - limitations, future work and conclusions
  - cite research references, including Matthias Muller papers I uploaded and Jeff Yee papers you can find at readme.md (first 3 papers located below Scientific Source section)

## Post-Production Prompt

Review final report through OPUS 4.1:

- Polish the writing on this document to be more aligned with a more formal scientific prose, language and tone, keeping scientific rigor, technical terminology, precise scientific phrasing
- now make a final review of the document for any detailed we missed

## Resulting Final Report

- ✅ Complete 724-line report covering the entire journey
- ✅ All sections present: Abstract, Introduction, Background, Experimental Setup, Results, Discussion, Conclusions, References, Appendices
- ✅ Proper LaTeX equations throughout
- ✅ Code snippets from all three implementations (Euler, XPBD, Phase-Synchronized)
- ✅ All 10 references properly formatted (Jeff Yee papers [1-6], Müller papers [7-8], supporting papers [9-10])
- ✅ Experimental data tables with real measurements
- ✅ Clear narrative explaining The Impossible Triangle, force mechanics failure, and phase-synchronized breakthrough
- ✅ All character encoding issues resolved

The content captures everything important:

- Your key insight about force mechanics vs wave mechanics at quantum scale
- The mathematical (not computational) limitation discovery
- The 360M:1 frequency mismatch problem
- XPBD's achievement (stability with real k) and limitation (8x slow waves)
- The radial_wave.py breakthrough achieving perfect c and λ
- Proper emphasis that this validates enormous quantum energy

You've successfully documented 4 months of groundbreaking research in a comprehensive report.
