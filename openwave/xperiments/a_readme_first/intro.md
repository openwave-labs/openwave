# INTRO TO OPENWAVE XPERIMENTS

## OpenWave

OpenWave is an open-source application designed to simulate the formation and behavior of matter and other modalities of energy — from the emergence of spacetime and energy waves, through the creation of particles, to the development of matter, motion, light, and heat — based on the deterministic subatomic model of the [Energy Wave Theory (EWT)](https://energywavetheory.com).

## Xperiments

OpenWave Xperiments is a collection of interactive physics simulations that brings Energy Wave Theory to life through real-time visualization and experimentation.

These xperiments allow you to explore the fundamental nature of spacetime and matter formation by running pre-configured demonstrations that showcase various wave phenomena, from simple spherical wave propagation to complex multi-source interference patterns. Each xperiment is fully customizable, enabling you to adjust critical parameters such as universe size, wave source configurations, and visualization settings to investigate physics at different scales—from Planck-scale interactions to macroscopic wave behaviors.

Whether you're researching the emergence of particles from wave convergence, analyzing constructive and destructive interference patterns, or creating entirely new experimental setups to test theoretical predictions, OpenWave Xperiments provides a virtual laboratory where you can manipulate the fundamental building blocks of reality and observe how energy waves interact within the aether medium.

**Recommended:**

- **Follow the demo sequence below if you are new to OpenWave**

## XPERIMENTS BASIC DEMO (follow this intro sequence)

### 1. Aether Vibration

- The aether is an EXTREMELY THIN FLUID-LIKE MEDIUM that fills all space.
- It vibrates at EXTREMELY HIGH FREQUENCIES (10^25Hz) which gives rise to the phenomena of spacetime.
- If you slow down the simulator frequency and increase the amp boost, you can observe WAVE PATTERNS. They are the visual effect of the aether's harmonic oscillations.
- Those wave patterns are the SOURCE of all physical phenomena in the universe. Including all ENERGY forms and FORCES, the formation of MATTER and TIME ITSELF (their frequency is the universe's clock).
- Now reduce the granule size and you'll clearly see them, they are called the ENERGY WAVES,
the fundamental building blocks of reality.

### 2. Spherical Wave

This xperiment demonstrates how a spherical wave propagates in a 3D medium.

### 3. Standing Wave

This xperiment demonstrates standing wave patterns that emerge from inward and outward wave interactions.

Standing waves are what gives matter its structure, from fundamental particles to atoms and molecules.

### 4. Play with Xperiments and Start your Research

Now that you are introduced to the basic concepts of wave phenomena, you can start experimenting with different wave configurations and parameters. Use the tools provided in the OpenWave platform to create your own simulations and explore the behavior of waves in various scenarios.

To launch the Xperiments Selector Menu:

- Make sure you follow the installation instructions at [README file](../../../README.md)
- Then on your terminal, run:

```bash
openwave -x
```
