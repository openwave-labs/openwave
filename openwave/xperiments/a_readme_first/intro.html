                <p>OpenWave is an open-source application designed to simulate the formation
                    and behavior of matter and other modalities of energy — from the emergence
                    of spacetime and energy waves, through the creation of particles, to the
                    development of matter, motion, light, and heat — based on the deterministic
                    subatomic model of the

        <h2>Xperiments</h2>
        
        <p>OpenWave Xperiments is a collection of interactive physics simulations that
            brings Energy Wave Theory to life through real-time visualization and experimentation.
            <br><br>
            These xperiments allow you to explore the fundamental nature of spacetime and matter
            formation by running pre-configured demonstrations that showcase various wave
            phenomena, from simple spherical wave propagation to complex multi-source interference
            patterns. Each xperiment is fully customizable, enabling you to adjust critical
            parameters such as universe size, wave source configurations, and visualization
            settings to investigate physics at different scales—from Planck-scale interactions
            to macroscopic wave behaviors.
            <br><br>
            Whether you're researching the emergence of particles from wave convergence, analyzing
            constructive and destructive interference patterns, or creating entirely new
            experimental setups to test theoretical predictions, OpenWave Xperiments provides a
            virtual laboratory where you can manipulate the fundamental building blocks of reality
            and observe how energy waves interact within the aether medium.</p>

    <h2>XPERIMENTS BASIC DEMO (follow this intro sequence)</h2>

    <h3>1. Aether Vibration</h3>
    <ul><li>The aether is a FLUID LIKE MEDIUM that fills all space.</li>
        <li>It vibrates at a EXTREMELY HIGH FREQUENCY (10^25Hz) which gives rise to the phenomena of spacetime.</li>
        <li>If you slow down the simulator frequency and increase the amp boost, you can observe
        WAVE PATTERNS. They are the visual effect of the aether's harmonic oscillations.</li>
        <li>Those wave patterns are the SOURCE of all physical phenomena in the universe. Including
        all ENERGY forms and FORCES, the formation of MATTER and TIME ITSELF (their frequency is the universe clock).
        <li>Now reduce the granule size and you'll clearly see them,
        they are called the ENERGY WAVES, the fundamental building blocks of reality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Spherical Wave</h3>
    <p>This xperiment demonstrates how a spherical wave propagates in a 3D medium.</p>

    <br><br>
    
    <h3>3. Standing Wave</h3>
    <p>This xperiment demonstrates standing wave patterns that emerge from inward and outward
        wave interactions.
        <br><br>
        Standing waves are what gives matter its structure, from fundamental particles to atoms and molecules.

    <h3>4. Play with Xperiments and Start your Research</h3>
    <p>Now that you are introduced to the basic concepts of wave phenomena, you can start
        experimenting with different wave configurations and parameters. Use the tools provided
        in the OpenWave Xperiments platform to create your own simulations and explore the
        behavior of waves in various scenarios.
    </p>

    <p>To launch the Xperiments Selector Menu, on your terminal, run:</p>
    <pre><code>openwave -x</code></pre>
