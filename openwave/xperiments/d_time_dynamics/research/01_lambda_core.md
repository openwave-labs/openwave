# Lambda as the Origin of Spacetime

## Core Thesis

Wavelength (λ) is the fundamental generator of spacetime. Space and time are not independent frames of reference — they are dynamic functions derived from wave properties, specifically lambda.

## The Mechanism

1. The Wave Center as Disturbance Source

The wave center (matter, the "fundamental particle") creates a disturbance in the fundamental wave's wavelength. This disturbance is the origin of all force interactions.

2. Lambda Creates Two Phases

When lambda is disturbed by a wave center, it generates:

- Spatial phase → the experience of space
- Temporal phase → the experience of time

These two phases together constitute spacetime — a dynamic consequence of wavelength variation, not a static background.

3. Time as Frequency, Not Linearity

The relationship is direct:

f = c / λ

- c (speed of light) is constant
- λ (wavelength) varies based on matter's influence
- f (frequency) changes as a result → this IS time

Time is not linear progression. Time is the rate of change — exactly what the wave equation models.

## Reframing the Problem

The Error: Fixed-Time Models

Treating time as a fixed frame of reference prevents accurate modeling. The wave equation describes rate of change, but if time itself is a variable output (not input), the model must reflect this.

The Correction

- Time → a variable, a function output
- Space → a data grid, information storage
- Lambda function → the source we must discover

The function that generates lambda variation will simultaneously define both spatial length and temporal rate.

### What Disturbs Lambda

| Source                              | Effect                                 |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Large mass concentrations (planets) | Gravitational disturbance in λ         |
| Uneven charge (± particles)         | Electromagnetic disturbance in λ       |
| Phase relationships (0° vs 180°)    | Attraction, repulsion, or annihilation |

Einstein's insight: gravity is a curvature/disturbance in spacetime — is precisely this: matter disturbs lambda, lambda generates spacetime.

## The Modeling Challenge

Two functions to derive from first principles:

1. λ(r, M, geometry) — Wavelength as function of distance, mass, and spatial configuration
2. A(r, M, geometry) — Amplitude as function of the same parameters

The geometry matters because real systems involve multiple point-masses creating interference patterns. The combined influence of all wave centers determines the local lambda and amplitude at any point.

## Summary

Lambda is not just a wave property — it is the origin of spacetime itself.

- Matter disturbs wavelength
- Wavelength variation creates spatial and temporal phases
- Time emerges as frequency (rate of change), not as linear progression
- Modeling spacetime requires treating time as output, not input
- The unified force emerges from understanding λ and A as functions of mass distribution and geometry
