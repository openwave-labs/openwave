# WAVE PROPERTIES

## MEDIUM PROPERTIES

- MEDIUM-DENSITY (ρ): propagates momentum, carries energy, defines wave-speed
- WAVE-SOURCE: defines frequency, rhythm, vibration and injects energy

## WAVE PROPERTIES (spherical longitudinal waves)

### Form

- WAVE-MODE: longitudinal, transverse (polarization)
- WAVE-TYPE: standing, traveling

### Energy

- WAVE-SPEED (c): constant, has direction of propagation
- WAVE-LENGTH (λ): changes when moving particle (doppler)
- WAVE-AMP (A): falloff at 1/r, near/far fields (max = color, min = black, zero = white-lines)
- WAVE-ENERGY (E): constant, conserved property (unmanifested <> manifested states)

### Rhythm

- FREQUENCY (f): c / λ (can change)
- TIME: the wave's frequency, rhythm

### Interaction

- INTERFERENCE: amplitude combinations (resonance, superposition) [sources diffs: phase, motion, freq]
- REFLECTION: changes direction of propagation (velocity vector)

### Notation

- ρ (rho) = medium density (Aether)
- c = wave speed (speed of light)
- λ (lambda) = wavelength
- A = wave amplitude
- f = frequency (c / λ)
- ω (omega) = angular frequency (2πf)
- ωt = temporal oscillation (controls rhythm, time-varying component)
- φ (phi) = spatial phase shift (controls phase shift, wave relationship, interference, position-dependent component)
- k = wave number (2π/λ)
- t = time
