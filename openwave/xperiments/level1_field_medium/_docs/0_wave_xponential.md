Certain clues are available to help the guessing process. First we need a wave distribution with spherical symmetry that will match the symmetry displayed by charge and mass forces of particles. Vector wave equations were ruled out because they have been extensively explored, especially the electromagnetic wave equation, and it is already known there are no e-m wave solutions which are spherically symmetrical. Also, we desire a connection with scalar quantum waves and this suggests that a scalar wave equation may be suitable. For geometric reasons (for example, properties in the +x direction should not be different than those in the -x direction), a wave equation should have second derivatives in the space coordinates.

The First Assumption of the Theory

Using these clues, and choosing the simplest relation between time and space derivatives, the first assumption of the theory is a
scalar wave equation as follows:

WAVE EQUATION ASSUMPTION (I)

Space can propagate scalar waves according to

∇²Φ - (1/c²) ∂²Φ/∂t² = 0

where Φ is a continuous scalar amplitude with values everywhere in space, and c is the propagation speed.

This equation is similar to many other oscillatory equations found in nature. It is a propagation equation for the particle waves and provides the law for their formation and structure. The wave amplitude as a scalar quantity has only a single numerical value at each point in space. Thus, it is not a vector quantity like light waves which have both amplitude and direction.

It is evident that this equation of space resonance waves is an implicit assumption that space has the properties needed to propagate them. Those properties are not yet understood.

This equation is solved using spherical coordinates in the Appendix if you wish to read it. One solution is an incoming spherical IN wave, and another is an outgoing spherical OUT wave. These two may be added to each other to form another solution which is the standing wave mentioned above. The result for the amplitudes Φ of the standing waves, taken from the appendix, is:

Φ = Φ₀ e^(iωt) sin(kr)/r

The first factor Φ₀ is the maximum amplitude. The exponential factor is an oscillator of frequency ω. It is modulated by the sine factor, which is a standing wave of wavelength 1/k. The amplitude becomes smaller as the radius r increases because of the 1/r factor.

The Properties of a Simple Space Resonance look like an electron.

From an analysis of the algebraic structure of the wave function φ shows properties which match those of particles, such as electrons, as follows:

1. Spherical Waves have Spherical Symmetry. The spherical symmetry of the space resonance waves agrees with the observation that particle forces have spherical symmetry. The fact that spherical solutions exist, in contrast with the electromagnetic wave equation which has no spherical wave solutions, is a happy coincidence. The amplitude of the waves decreases with distance r exactly like the forces of charge and mass. Charge and mass forces are introduced into the model below with two more assumptions about properties of space. Charge and mass are properties of space and the waves, rather than substances carried by the particle.

2. The wave Amplitude is finite at the Center. The standing wave amplitude at the center is Φ₀ as you can see if you put r = 0 into the above equation for the amplitude. This feature resolves a paradox of the usual electron model, because the usual potential energy (PE = q/r) of a point electron's charge becomes infinite at r = 0, which is obviously impossible. This unsatisfactory infinite field is a well-known difficulty of the usual electron model. Instead, a finite amplitude at r = 0 is necessary to satisfactorily explain electric charge behavior. Surprisingly, the space resonance provides it.

3. The Space Resonance has an anti-resonance. The wave solution shows that space resonances come in two varieties. The second variety is an anti-resonance, just like an electron which has an anti-particle, the positron. Two wave solutions occur because of the three-dimensional geometry of space. In one solution, the "IN" wave amplitude is positive at the center and the "OUT" wave is negative. In the other solution, the OUT amplitude wave is positive and the IN is negative. Both the resonance and anti-resonance standing wave solutions have the same algebraic structure except for opposite signs of amplitude; that is, they have a phase difference of π radians
and are related by,

Φ⁽⁺⁾(r) = - Φ⁽⁻⁾(r)

As a result, if a resonance approaches and is superimposed upon an anti-resonance, their opposite amplitudes annihilate each other, just as the electron and positron can annihilate.

4. The wave node spacing is the Compton wavelength. If the frequency ω=2πf, of the resonance is chosen to be the electron mass-frequency, f = mc²/h, then the distance between wave nodes is h/mc, the Compton wavelength, already a familiar quantity in
measurements of electron behavior and theory.

## A Space Resonance Has Spherical Symmetry

FIGURE 12-1. The moving waves of space resonance.

The resonance is composed of a spherical IN wave which converges to the center and an OUT wave which diverges from the center. These two waves combine to form a standing wave whose spherical peaks and nodes are like layers of an onion. The amplitude is a scalar number, differing from the electromagnetic waves which have a vector amplitude. At the center, the standing wave amplitude is finite rather than infinite, in better agreement with electron measurements than the classical point electron model.
