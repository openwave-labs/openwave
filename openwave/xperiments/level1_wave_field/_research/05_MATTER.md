## COMPOSITE PARTICLES

- particle stability / decay / annihilation
  - add multiple WCs (K from slider)
  - initial distance, arrangement
  - wait reaction
- particle lock (near-field region)
  - added energy / velocity
- spin (angular momentum)
- visualize & measure

## Complex Structures

**Multi-Center Particles**:

- Fundamental particles can combine
- Multiple wave centers form bound state
- Standing wave pattern spans multiple centers

**Examples**:

- **Electron**: 10 wave centers in specific configuration
- **Proton**: Complex multi-center structure
- **Neutron**: Different multi-center arrangement

### Electron Formation

**"Lock" Event**:

- Two wave centers approach each other
- At critical distance, standing wave pattern locks
- Centers bind together → electron forms
- Transformation visible in simulation

**Conditions**:

- Specific approach velocity / kinetic energy
- Other Specific energy configuration, external force
- Specific wave phase relationship

**Visualization**:

- Show two centers approaching
- Standing wave pattern changes
- Sudden "snap" into bound configuration
- New composite particle with different properties

### Particle Binding

**Binding Mechanism**:

- Wave interference creates attractive/repulsive regions
- Centers settle into stable configuration
- Minimum amplitude principle maintains binding
- Similar to quantum mechanical orbitals

**Stability**:

- Bound state = local energy minimum
- Perturbations cause oscillations, not unbinding
- Different stable configurations = different particles

## The Electron's Special Role

### Wave Transformation

**Electron as Transformer**:

- Electron has unique wave center configuration
- Acts as special reflector with transformation properties
- Incoming energy waves → reflected as EM waves
- Like a wavelength/frequency converter

**Why Electron is Special**:

- Specific standing wave pattern (two-center structure?)
- Resonance properties different from other particles
- Can oscillate at different frequencies
- Each oscillation frequency → EM wave of that frequency

### EM Wave Generation

**Oscillating Electron**:

1. Electron oscillates (driven by external wave or force)
2. Oscillation modulates wave reflection pattern
3. Reflected waves have EM wave character
4. EM waves propagate outward at speed c

**Frequency Relationship**:

- Electron oscillation frequency = EM wave frequency
- Higher frequency oscillation → higher frequency EM wave
- Energy of EM wave ∝ frequency (E = hf)

**Applications**:

- Accelerating electrons → EM radiation (synchrotron, antenna)
- Electron transitions in atoms → photons (specific frequencies)
- All light/radio/X-rays from electron oscillations
