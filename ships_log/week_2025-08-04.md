# Week Review - 2025-08-04

## Summary

This week focused on establishing the project foundation, refining requirements based on updated granule mass equations, and beginning development of OpenWave's first module - the **waves engine**. Additionally, I explored data visualization libraries and continued refining our AI-accelerated development workflow.

## Initial Planning & Setup

### Constants Strategy

**Decision**: Start with Wave Constants for their alignment with the energy wave concept

**Future consideration**: Extend OpenWave features to "translate" Classical Constants into the simulation

### Project Commitment

**Time allocation**: ~30 hours/week for the next 4 months (minimum)

### Collaboration approach

- Heavy lifting handled independently to avoid disrupting other work
- Direction and validation needed for physics engine alignment with EWT model
- Requirements and architecture maturation on Miro board

### Requirements Refinement

- Received updated granule mass equations
- Constants source documentation
- Original requirements documentation
- Created shared folder with published papers for review
- Awaiting feedback on additional relevant papers to include

## Key Activities

### 1. Waves Engine Module Development

**Purpose**: Create a core engine for modeling EWT energy waves behavior on aether granules

**Planned functionalities**:

- Wave properties (wavelength, amplitude, period, speed, energy)
- Wave emission mechanics
- Wave reflection algorithms
- Wave propagation modeling
- Wave interactions (constructive and destructive interference)
- Wave energy transfer mechanisms
- Additional fundamental wave functionalities

### 2. Data Visualization Research

**Discovery**: Found an open-source Python library for animating mathematical functions in 3D

- Maintained by a community of ~500 programmers
- Ideal for our visualization needs
- Planning experimental implementations with visual demos

**Development approach**:

- Initial focus on backend functions only
- Command-line accessibility prioritized
- GUI development deferred until backend is robust

### 3. AI-Accelerated Development

**Current experiments**:

- Testing GPT-5 (newly released)
- Allowing OpenAI break-in time for bug fixing and performance stabilization
- Testing OpenAI Codex for safe, fast coding practices
- Ensuring GPT training on our specific Python libraries
- Documenting workflows for optimal AI assistance

### 4. Documentation & Tracking

- Comprehensive documentation on Miro board
- Regular updates on current tasks
- Reference materials for ongoing work
- Shared folder with published papers

## Terminology Decision

### Discussion on Wave Nomenclature

**Question raised**: Should we use "Energy Waves" or "Quantum Waves"?

**Decision**: Use **"Quantum Waves"** terminology

**Rationale**:

- Honors pioneers like Dr. Milo Wolff and Gabriel LaFreniere
- Maintains consistency with foundational literature (e.g., "Schrödinger's Universe")
- Gives proper credit to theory originators
- EWT will be referenced and hyperlinked throughout as the overarching scientific model

## Next Steps

- Continue wavesEngine module implementation
- Develop visualization prototypes
- Refine AI-assisted coding workflows
- Maintain comprehensive documentation on Miro board
- Review additional papers for requirements inclusion
- Mature requirements and architecture on Miro board
